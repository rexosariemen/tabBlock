In our two loves there is but one respect, Though in our lives a separable spite, Which though it alter not love's sole effect, Yet doth it steal sweet hours from love's delight. I may not evermore acknowledge thee, Lest my bewailed guilt should do thee shame,",

If thou wilt leave me, do not leave me last, When other petty griefs have done their spite",

    text: `Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
And sorry I could not travel both
And be one traveler, long I stood
And looked down one as far as I could
To where it bent in the undergrowth;

    Then took the other, as just as fair,
    And having perhaps the better claim,
    Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
    Though as for that the passing there
Had worn them really about the same,

    And both that morning equally lay
In leaves no step had trodden black.
      Oh, I kept the first for another day!
Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
    I doubted if I should ever come back.

I shall be telling this with a sigh
Somewhere ages and ages hence:
      Two roads diverged in a wood, and Iâ€”
    I took the one less traveled by,
    And that has made all the difference.`,
