In our two loves there is but one respect, Though in our lives a separable spite Which though it alter not love's sole effect, Yet doth it steal sweet hours from love's delight.",

I grant, sweet love, thy lovely argument Deserves the travail of a worthier pen; Yet what of thee thy poet doth invent He robs thee of, and pays it thee again. He lends thee virtue, and he stole that word From thy behaviour; beauty doth he give"

To win me soon to hell, my female evil, Tempteth my better angel from my side, And would corrupt my saint to be a devil Wooing his purity with her foul pride. And whether that my angel be turn'd fiend, Suspect I may, yet not directly tell;"

        "Two roads diverged in a yellow wood, And sorry I could not travel both And be one traveler long I stood And looked down one as far as I could To where it bent in the undergrowth; Then took the other, as just as fair, And having perhaps the better claim, Because it was grassy and wanted wear; Though as for that the passing there Had worn them really about the same And both that morning equally lay In leaves no step had trodden black.",
        "Oh, I kept the first for another day! Yet knowing how way leads on to way,I doubted if I should ever come back. I shall be telling this with a sigh Somewhere ages and ages hence: Two roads diverged in a wood, and I took the one less traveled by, And that has made all the difference."
